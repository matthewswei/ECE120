; This program goes through memory locations x3132-x313B and adds the values stored
; to a common register if the number is positive. I knew I had to use the BR operand to loop the
; code and I knew I needed to use load commands to load values stored in memory locations to
; registers. I also knew I needed the LEA command to store the value of the memory address and
; ADD to utilize the counter register and adjust the memory address. After finding which operands
; I needed, it was just a matter of setting up the code and formatting.

; R2 is a temporary register used for holding values at a memory location
; R3 stores the memory address to be used to grab a value
; R4 holds the counter to make sure the program executes 10 times
; R5 holds the total sum of positive integers


0011 0001 0000 0000 ; x3100 - starting address of the program

; The program description and code starts here
0101 101 101 1 00000 ; R5 <- 0, Set sum register equal to 0
0001 100 101 1 01010 ; R4 <- R4 + 10, Initialize counter to 10
1110 011 000101101 ; R3 <- M[x3103 + x002D],Load address register with memory location x3131
0001 011 011 1 00001; R3 <- R3 + 1, Add 1 to address register to increase address value by 11
0101 010 010 1 00000 ; R2 <- 0, Reset value in value register to 0
0110 010 011 000001 ; R2 <- M[R3 + SEXT(000000)] Set value register with value stored in R3
0000 100 000000001 ; Check to see if number is positive, skip next line if number is negative
0001 101 101 000 010 ; R5 <- R5 + R2, Add value to total sum
0001 100 100 1 11111 ; R4 <- R4 - 1, Subract counter by 1
0000 101 111111001; Check to see if counter has reached 0 yet, branch back to line 21 if 0
